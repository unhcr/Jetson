Using supervised machine learning, UNHCR designed Project Jetson, an engine that is fed data and uses trained models to predict the displacement of persons in Somalia.<\/p>\n<p>Forced displacement is a complex phenomenon. Mathematical evidence shows that there are certain factors, such as food insecurity and violent conflict, as well as the appeal of the destination region, in terms of price, distance, and stability, that cause people to move. Certain combinations of these factors are more likely to make people move than others.<\/p>\n<p>Project Jetson is an on-going experiment to discover, understand, and measure the specific factors that cause, indicate or exacerbate the forced displacement of Somalis.<\/p>\n<p>Project Jetson gives UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations the potential to become more proactive in their response efforts \u2014 a transformation that could significantly improve on-the-ground relief services and more importantly the lives of those who are forcibly

protection outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>The following metrics of success have been developed to evaluate the overall performance of the project:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Solve the challenge given by a UNHCR field
