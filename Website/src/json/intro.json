It has further underlined the importance of partnership, of collaboration, and of transparency. <\/span><\/p>\n","first_section":"<h2>About the data<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The data behind the experiment is central to the overall process. Multiple data inputs are fed into the machine. All data is anonymized and disaggregated per region &#8211; and per month. The outcome dataset is a combination of seven years worth of factors that may contribute to forced displacement movement. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Predictors were either suggested by staff within operations and\/or refugees themselves. This human-centered approach included focus groups, as well as semi-structured interviews). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The predictor factors are: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weather and climate;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conflict;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">market prices;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">historical population movement patterns (both for internally displaced people and refugees).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open data is key for the Jetson engine to work. Having <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/opendatahandbook.org\/glossary\/en\/terms\/open-data\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">technically and legally open data<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows humanitarian actors &#8211; and others &#8211; to make sometimes life-saving decisions to help people, whether those fleeing, or those hosting those who have fled. For example, knowing the number of people arriving at a certain time to a particular region can allow for sufficient preparation, of \u00a0for example, contingencies, prepositioning of resources &#8211; including human resources. It may also help to identify and attend first to those who are most vulnerable. Jetson represents therefore, a new way of processing and potentially using data. Crucially, it is also an example on how collaboration for open data could potentially, alleviate human suffering and save lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UNHCR Innovation Service wants Project Jetson to become an open process. Creating a functioning prototype that other UNHCR operations and other humanitarian partners could utilize with their own data sets is our version of a fruitful future. For this to be possible, many data sets should be duly processed (e.g. anonymized, cleaned) and openly shared in, ideally, one single data portal. In order to predict, collaboration and partnerships are imperative. \u00a0A departure from myopic, territorial approaches of the past, and another step into a future humanitarian response that is multidisciplinary in nature, partnership by default, and whole of society in responsibility and accountability.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Our collaborators and partners:<\/h3>\n<h4>Our data sources and\/or main project partners:<\/h4>\n<p>Climate: <a href=\"http:\/\/sddr.faoswalim.org\/climate_aws.php?catid=2&amp;subid=16&amp;mapsubid=18\">FAO-SWALIM<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wmo.int\/cpdb\/somalia\">WMO<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.icpac.net\">IGAD-ICPAC<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unitar.org\/unosat\/maps\/SOM\">UNOSAT<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/climate4development.worldbank.org\/open\/\">World Bank<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Infrastructure: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unitar.org\/unosat\/maps\/HOA\">UNOSAT<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Conflict: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.acleddata.com\">ACLED<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Food Security: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fsnau.org\/ipc\/ipc-map\">FAO-FSNAU<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fews.net\/east-africa\/somalia\">FEWES<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Population: <a href=\"http:\/\/data.unhcr.org\">UNHCR<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/reliefweb.int\/report\/somalia\/unhcr-somalia-protection-return-monitoring-network-prmn-notes-methodology\">PRMN<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Data Science support: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unglobalpulse.org\">UN Global Pulse<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hrbdt.ac.uk\">Essex University,<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uptake.org\/\">Uptake.org<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>The technology behind:<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>About time series analysis<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The experiment consists of measuring multiple data sources and variables to see how changes over time affect the movement of people of concern to UNHCR, particularly refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs). A basic time-series analysis was conducted by machine-learning, in which multiple sources of data\/variables are fed into the machine. A time series analysis consists of collecting a series of data points, such as precipitation, changes in markets, and then arranging them with certain time intervals, such as one month, over a period of time. In this case, seven years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time series can be analyzed using open source or common statistical commercial software. They are often used by the finance sector, statisticians or econometricians to conduct research. However, for this experiment, we combined time series analysis with machine learning: time series analysis meets computer science. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>About machine learning processes:<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The machine learning process uses a combination of commonly available commercial software, as well as open source software. Data is fed into the machine, and the machine subsequently attempts to find the best fit, and the best output that explains the behavior of data points that occured in the past, in order to predict the future. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The machine-learning process in this particular experiment has <\/span><b>three caveats: <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a) the machine does not know the data after either June 2017 or September 2017, and carries out all of its calculations based historical data &#8211; without knowing what the actual arrivals were in the subsequent months. This means that the machine was only fed with data until a certain point &#8211; even though we had the full dataset until the month in question. We kept this month blank in the machine, in order to serve as a training set. This was done in order to see how well the machine predicted something that already happened, constituting an historical training set.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, b) the machine is given an algorithm &#8211; a formula or a rule &#8211; on which to run calculations. However, the algorithm that is given to the machine in order to conduct these calculations does not contain the time variable. Therefore, even though the data is arranged per month, per region, the machine is agnostic of the date, since it is not included in the formula. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The machine then, reads all the data and attempts to find the best fit. These are the best computer-produced models that include all possible data points, and how best they are interrelated to each other. For example, if at a certain point the machine sees more arrivals, it will try to graph how does conflict interrelate with increase in conflict and\/or lack of rain. The result of this process are 20 models per region studied, in order to understand the overall region population movement. A total of 380 models were tested in this experiment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the model selection, the engine tests all 20 models in a certain month and produces the best examples on which to predict the month. This means that the model that can best predict the arrivals for next month may be the same, but equally could change each month, depending on the region. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FInally, there c) is a data imputation process behind the engine, conducted automatically by the machine. Imputation means that for any missing value (NA) the machine will carry out an automatic assumption assumption behind the distribution &#8211; which means \u2018it\u2019 will attempt to calculate the result, even with that missing value, trying to see the interrelation of that missing data value with the other variables that are present.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","jetson_models":"<h3>About the map<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The map was requested by UNHCR\u2019s operation in Somalia as a red-light style of visualization. It portrays the level of critically for movement. Moderate means Jetson is predicting the arrivals of next month within the range of the average arrivals of the past 3 months. High means the machine prediction of arrivals \u00a0is higher than the average but less than 100% increase in arrivals, and Critical means is double the average (more than a 100% increase).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>About the engine<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graphs above are based on different models that are selected based on seven different statistical or computer-science methods: 1) the best model data that \u2018fits\u2019 the historical data (R^2); 2) its mean absolute error (MAE); 3) the multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) seed value of 50 randomly-selected historical values; 4) the percentage of computer prediction accuracy (ACC); 5) Bayesian information criterion (BIC); Akaike information criterion (AIC) and; \u00a07) a simple pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) for either the past 20 months (ACC\/PCC) and\/or the overall seven years of data (rest). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The model selection methods mentioned above attempt to measure the accuracy of future predictions, and are the difference between the future predictive arrivals vs. actual arrivals. In short, they describe the margin of error of arrivals provided by the machine vs. reality. For example, the higher the MAE, the less accurate the prediction. R^2 is the value of how close the model is based on historical data. The closer (or fit) the model, the higher the value, with 1.0 being the most ideal fit. Each model will have different results of each of the five measures. <\/span><\/p>\n","second_section":"<h2>Project Jetson Version 1.0<\/h2>\n<h3>What\u2019s new?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Version 1.0 is the first public version of Jetson.
